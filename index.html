<p> This Website will help you procced in the magical experiece of playing ARK
<br>
<br> Basics
<br>
<p> The first thing want to do when you spawn in your world is look around for some Dodo birds and dinosaurs that are may look agressive.
<p> When a green text pops up at the top of your screen it should say " Level up is availble Access inventory to level up" along those lines.
<p> When you go into your inventory there should be some stats and a plus sign next to it, click on the plus button to level up that stat.
<p> To learn new items when you level up it will take you to a menu where you can learn new items called engrams, the bottom left there should be
<p> be something that says engram points when that runs out you can learn anything eles till you level up again.
<br>
<p> Crafting and Resources
<br>
<p> Now you know the basics now it's time to do some crafting and resource gathering. First thing you need to know about resources it's not the same as
<p> Minecraft, where you use a axe for wood and a pickaxe for stone. Insted in ARK is a axe for stone and and wood and a pickaxe is for flint and metal. It's weird I don't
<p> know why Wildcard, the creators of ARK did that but anyway back to crafting and resources. When your crafting multiple things at once you might want to be 
<p> careful so you don't craft more than you need. I was crafting spears and made way, to many and lost all my resources. There are a lot of resources in ARK, I'd
<p> there are more than a hundred resources. So if you have played Minecraft before you know that you need upgraded tools to mine certin things, well same for ARK you need
<p> metal to procced in ARK. Not only metal tools to procced and get better items but also to get resources quicker, and more efficently. The better tier of tool
<p> the more resources you'll get while mineing,cutting and harvesting creatures. the next section will show you what this game is all about.
<br>
<p> Creatures
<br>
<p> Now you might be thinking what ARK is all about, well ARK is survival dinosaur game where tame dinosaur, fantasy
<p> creatures, build structures, play with friends and much, much more. So to tame dinosaurs you
<p> can either knock it out or passive tame it. So if you want to passive time you have to go, up to the creature and check it's
<p> feeding requirements get the food or resource, and put in your last hot bar slot and press what ever button it says to feed it
<p> should say you can feed it when it's hungry again. Now to knock out creatures you will need to either punch, it constantly, knock it out with tanq arrows which
<p> require one narcotic and one arrow and tanquilizer darts which require a simple sniper bullet, narcotics and metal, when you knock it out
<p> it should say unconscious next to it's name in brackets. Once you knock it out access it's inventory and put it's taming food in their inventory
<p> and wait for it to wake up when it's tamed but bewear also if it's a big creature like a T-Rex, you might want to put in some narcotic
<p> which needs 5 narcoberries and 1 spoiled meat. Force feed it narcotic to raise it's torpor, carnivours prefer prime meat over normal meat, herbivours perfer mejoberries 
<p> or vegi cakes. With creatures you can not only can you level up your self but you can also level up your tamed dinosaurs aswell!
<br>
<p> Maps/DlC
<br>
<p> Currently there are 10 diffrent DLC's in ARK and another on coming on June 22 2022 it's call "Fjordur" with a new creture coming
<p> called "Desmodus Draculae" a bat like cretures that can locate and stub dinos in a single screech. It gets it's name from
<p> Dracula the vampire. Also it's a that can pick up wild dinosaurs, and eat them. They are found in cave dark cave, be carful
<p> though they are extremely powerful and adaptive in the dark.
<br>
<p> Fjordur Map
<br>
<p> Fjodur is a map with big caves, awesome, creatures, structure diffrent biomes. Not only are standered creatures in Fjodur, but it also
<p> has unique creatures aswell such as the Maewing, Desmodus Draculae and much more. When you play with your tribemates you can
<p> explore caves, fight dinosaurs, steal eggs, breed tamed dinosaurs, fight bosses and fight other players. From personal experience
<p> of playing ARK my favorite part is getting chased by creatures I pissed off and playing with friends. I also love sabotaging
<p> my friends base and stealing their dinos and starting wars. But anyway but for the Fjodur map it's known for it's big map size and many original
<p> creaturse from maps other DLCs which has the Rock Drake. Anyway while all the other DLCs have radiation, heatwaves, and other
<p> deadly things. Fjordur has most of creatures in it I have ever seen, and alot of new fun stuff to try out. Over all ARK truely is a game of mysteries,
<p> deadly things to fight, see, tame and alot more things to do for example fly around on ptranadons, find shipwreks, explore underwater caves and much more to see,
<p> fight and survive. That's all for Fjordur that's been announced so for.
<br>
<p> Shoulder Pets
<br>
<p> Shoulder are well pets that sit on your shoulder. So all Shoulder Ptes have unique abilities. The Sinomacrops has a ability where it can scare of small creatures and has a
<p> fly ability where if you hold down your jump key/button you start flying. The otter has an ability where it can... well it just looks EXTREMELY cute.
<br>
<p> Armour
<br>
<p> There are many diffrent types of armour in ARK, there is Hazard armour which makes you immune to radiation damage, then theres ghillie armour which makes it so creatures don't notice them
<p> emediately only when you get really close to them, theres cloth armour which is the starter armour it's not great but it's
<p> a start, theres riot armour which is the best armour, theres also hide armour you can craft by killing things and getting hide
<br>
<p> Taming
<br>
<p> When taming creatures it's always hard to get all the meateaters away from your tame. There are many ways of dealing with this issue, is to either
<p> trap the creature your taming or kill all the the meat eaters away with a strong creature like a Rex, Wyvern, Griffin or other
<p> strong creatures you have in your arsenal. The best way I found is to get some narcotics and wait for it to starve, once it's
<p> purple bar is low (torpor bar) is low force feed the unconscious creature narcotic and the torpor bar will go up. The yellow bar (tamimg bar)
<p> is almost full thats when you've almost tamed the creature. If you hit the creature or something else does it will lose
<p> taming effectiveness and it will tame slower plus it will also lose bonus levels once it's tamed. There is another type of taming food called "Kibble".
<p> Kibble makes it so you don't lose as much taming effectiveness (the more bites the unconscious creature the taming effectiveness gradually goes down slightly)
<p> Kibble also makes it so the tame goes faster so you don't have to deal with pesky meateaters who want to ruin your tame. Some creatures can fly so it might
<p> make it a little harder to knock out, a way to deal with this is to use a Bola. A Bola is a engram learned at level 9, it's used to down flying creatures like
<p> the ptranaon or the pelagornis ect. But some flying creatures can't be down by a bola they have to be downed with a Net Gun or A Chain Bola which needs a balista
<p> turret. The big flying creaures a Wyverns, Griffins, Argentavis ect. Theres taming advice for you, another thing to note is some fantasy creatures require blood
<p> packs to tame which you can get from using the blood syringe on yourself to extract the blood (you might die)
<br>
<p> Skins
<br>
<p> Skins are scattered around the world of ARK skins are used to customize tools and dinosaurs, the raptor has it's own skin same as the parasaur. Tools are also
<p> customizeable. ARK recently got skins for the raptor, parasaur, axe and spear/pike.
<br>
<p> Events
<br>
<p> Events are always happening in ARK. Curently ark has a Valantines Day event calleed "Love Evolved" Starts in February 9th and ends in February 16th. Theres also The Eggcelent
<p> Adventure, Fear Evolved and Turkey Trial (not telling what's in the events). Anyway Events have bonuses and buffs.
<br>
<p> Supply Crates
