<br>
<br> Basics
<br>
<p> The first thing want to do when you spwn in your world is look around for some Dodo birds and dinosaurs that are may look agressive.
<p> When a green text pops up at the top of your screen it should say " Level up is availble Access  inventory to level up"
<p> When you go into your inventory there should be some stats and a plus sign next to it, click on the plus button to level up that stat.
<br>
<p> Crafting and Resources
<br>
<p> Now you know how to do the basics now it's time to do some crafting and resource gathering.First thing you need to know about resources it's not the same
<p> Minecraft where you use a axe for wood and a pickaxe for stone. Insted in ARK is a axe for stone and and wood and a pickaxe is for flint. It's weird I don't
<p> know why Wildcard the creators of ARK did that but anyway back to crafting and resources. When your crafting multiple things at once you might want to be 
<p> careful so you don't craft more than you need. I was crafting spears and made way to many and lost all my resources. There are a lot of resources in ark, I'd
<p> there are more than a hundred resources in ARK. So if you have played Minecraft be for you need upgraded tools to mine certin things Well same for ARK you need
<p> metal to procced in Ark. Not only metal tools to procced and get better items but also to get resources quicker and more efficently. The better tier of tool
<p> the more resources you'll get while mineing,cutting and harvesting creatures. the next section will show you what this game is all about.
