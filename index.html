<p> This Website will help you procced in the magical experiece of playing ARK
<br>
<br> Basics
<br>
<p> The first thing want to do when you spwn in your world is look around for some Dodo birds and dinosaurs that are may look agressive.
<p> When a green text pops up at the top of your screen it should say " Level up is availble Access  inventory to level up"
<p> When you go into your inventory there should be some stats and a plus sign next to it, click on the plus button to level up that stat.
<br>
<p> Crafting and Resources
<br>
<p> Now you know how to do the basics now it's time to do some crafting and resource gathering.First thing you need to know about resources it's not the same
<p> Minecraft where you use a axe for wood and a pickaxe for stone. Insted in ARK is a axe for stone and and wood and a pickaxe is for flint. It's weird I don't
<p> know why Wildcard the creators of ARK did that but anyway back to crafting and resources. When your crafting multiple things at once you might want to be 
<p> careful so you don't craft more than you need. I was crafting spears and made way to many and lost all my resources. There are a lot of resources in ark, I'd
<p> there are more than a hundred resources in ARK. So if you have played Minecraft be for you need upgraded tools to mine certin things Well same for ARK you need
<p> metal to procced in Ark. Not only metal tools to procced and get better items but also to get resources quicker and more efficently. The better tier of tool
<p> the more resources you'll get while mineing,cutting and harvesting creatures. the next section will show you what this game is all about.
<br>
<p> Creatures
<br>
<p> Now you might be thinking what ARK is all about, well ARK is survival dinosaur game where tame dinosaur, fantasy
<p> creatures, build structures, play with friends and much, much more anyway back to the creatures. So to tame dinosaurs you
<p> can either knock it out or passive tame it. So if you want to passive time you have to go up to the creature and check it's
<p> feeding requirements get the food or resource and put in your last hot bar slot and press what ever button it says to feed it
<p> should say you can feed it when it's hungry again. Now to knock out creatures you will need to either punch it constantly, knock it out with tanq arrows which
<p> require one narcotic and one arrow and tanquilizer dars which require simple sniper bullet, narcotics and metal when you knock it out
<p> it should say unconscious next to it's name in brackets. Once you knock it out access it's inventory and put it's taming food in there
<p> and wait for it to wake up when it's tamed but also if it's a big creature like a T-Rex you might want to put in some narcotic
<p> which needs 5 narcoberries and 1 spoiled meat. Force feed it narcotic toraise it's torpor carnivours prefer prime meat over normal meat and herbivours perfer mejoberries or
<p> vegi cakes. With creatures you can not only can you level up your self but you can also level up your tamed dinosaurs aswell!
<br>
<p> Maps/DlC
<br>
<p> Currently there are 10 diffrent DLC's in ARK and another on coming on June 22 2022 it's call "Fjodur" with a new creture coming
<p> called "Desmodus Dreculae" a bat like cretures that can locate and stub dinos in a single screech. It gets it's name from
<p> Dracula the vampire. Also it's a that can pick up wild dinosaurs and eat them. They are found in cave.
<br>
<p>Fjodur
<br>
<p> Fjodur is a map with big caves, awesome, creatures, structsers diffrent biomes. Not only are standered creatures in Fjodur but it also
<p> unique creatures aswell such as the Maewing, Desmodous Drculea and much more. When you play with your tribemates you can
<p> explore caves, fight dinosaurs, steal eggs, breed tamed dinosaurs, fight bosses and fight other players. From personal experience
<p> of playing ARK my favorite part is getting chased by creatures I pissed off and playing with friends. I also love sabotaging
<p> my friends baseand stealing their dinos and starting wars. But anyway but for the Fjodur map it's amazing for it's size
